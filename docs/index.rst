Spaczz provides fuzzy matching and multi-token regex matching
functionality to `spaCy <https://spacy.io/>`_.
Spaczzâ€™s components have similar APIs to their spaCy counterparts and spaczz pipeline components
can integrate into spaCy pipelines where they can be saved/loaded as models.


While this website will eventually be the home for definitive spaczz documentation, for now it is kind of a placeholder.
Please visit `spaczz's GitHub page <https://github.com/gandersen101/spaczz>`_ for now to see usage documentation and more.

Installation
------------

Spaczz can be installed using pip.

.. code:: Python

    pip install spaczz
